# CNC router for mechanical etching of PCBs (2015)
Designed a 3-axis CNC router for PCB etching during undergraduate studies. Cassis modelled with steel sheets and used 3
servo motors to control the 3 axes. The servo motors were controlled by Arduino Due (32-bit ARM SAM microcontroller). And the CNC controller was developed using MATLAB which communicated with the microcontroller using USB serial ports.
